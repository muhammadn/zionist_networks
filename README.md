1. Install all the libraries `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
2. Just run the `python3 getnetworks.py` and a file `zionist_networks.txt` will save all the networks.

Have fun and enjoy hacking zionists!

Note: it will generate a line by line list of networks in a .txt file, you can tell nmap/masscan by using `-iL` flag to read this file and run the scans.

Also requires chromedriver to be installed in `/usr/local/bin`
